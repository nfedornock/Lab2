        "#### I choose the six entities: Pet, Enclosure, Pet Food, Customers, Loyalty Program, and Adoption.  I choose these based of how I interpreted the description of the assignment.  I struggled some places with coming up with some verb relationships between some of the such as between enclosure and pet food.  I settled with that the enclosure is the holding place for the food and some other stretches I had are present as well.  I went for at least 3 attributes per each entity as we have been doing in class and other assignments.  I also ended up having foreign keys that were properly labeled to show they are there. I made the pet food and adoption have the same primary key due to the description of they are both counted as transactions but there are different types."
